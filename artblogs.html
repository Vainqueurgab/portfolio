                NFTs

<p>Investment in the NFT space has grown so aggressively and has become so popular. This explosion was evident last year with some NFTs being sold and auctioned for millions of dollars. In the first half of 2021 only, $2.5 billion was generated. It has become impossible to not to be involved in the frenzy around NFTs, but what exactly are they? In this article we are going to cover the history of NFTs, what they are, why people choose to invest in them, how to buy and sell them, the most popular NFTs, and finally their pros and cons.</p>
<h2 class="section__title">History of NFTs</h2>
<p> NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens) blew up and became popular in 2017 when Dapper Labs launched a decentralised application called Cryptokitties on the Ethereum blockchain, selling tradable NFT cats on the chain. NFTs have seen rapid growth since then. In February 2021 alone, investors and collectors spent $250 million in NFT based artwork like memes, pictures, and GIFs compared to the year2020 which was $200 million.</p>
<h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
<p>A non-fungible token is a non-interchangeable unit of data stored on the blockchain. They are digital files on the blockchain ledgers that are unique and provide proof of ownership. On the blockchain network, it is traceable and trackable; anyone can access it to see who owns a particular NFT and who the original creator is. Non-interchangeable in the sense that they can’t be exchanged for another similar one like cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
Fungible – it means something that can be exchanged for something.
Non-fungible – something unique that can’t be exchanged and can’t be split.

 
For instance, when you decide to buy sweets from a local store, you choose to pay it with the dollar because they are fungible, but if you have your artwork or painting then it’s original and can’t be swapped, it’s non-fungible.
NFTs can also be thought of as a certificate of authenticity that verifies and validates that a certain person owns a digital asset. NFTs can range anything from GIFs to jpegs, to Youtube videos and even tweets, virtual cards, video game characters, and virtual real estate that can be bought and sold on various marketplaces. Just like physical assets, NFT price is largely driven by market demand.
Why buy NFTs?
When a person buys an NFT, the original creator of the asset still has some rights to the asset and the copyright. But still, it doesn’t mean they’re taken out of circulation, people can still download it, share it as many times as they want to. But what exactly pushes someone to spend hundreds of dollars on a Cryptokitty or a widely available video? These are some of the reasons why someone would like to buy an NFT.
1.      First – The first token creators of various companies or individuals will have some perceived value compared to the successors.  A good example is the Pokemon card which is gaining popularity, and the most expensive one is the one that is in the first edition.
 
2.  	Utility and benefits – Let’s say the iconic Michael Jackson was still alive and sold a limited 50 tokens. Just by owning one of the gems, you could have lifetime access to his shows. These NFTs will quickly rise in value and be popular just because of the benefits.
3.  	Unique and of some cultural significance – Anyone could have a copy of the Mona Lisa painting but only one museum can have the real painting. Investors would want to buy an NFT only because it is unique and rare in their eyes and they would believe to own a piece of history that is high in value.
4.      Ownership History – An NFT could be high in demand simply because an important person owned it like a celebrity or a politician. Because of this, it would spark the interest of NFT enthusiasts.
How to make NFTs and sell them.
When an artist chooses to mint their work and turn it into an NFT, they turn it into a digital collector’s item. Digital art is being sold for mind-blowing prices therefore how to make and sell an NFT is in the mind of any NFT enthusiast or artist.
1.      First, you’ll need to decide on the NFT platform to use, mint your NFT, and a payment wallet used to pay transaction fees and receive any payments. Minting is the process where one can create an NFT and register it on the blockchain. This requires you, as an artist, to mint your piece of artwork on a certain blockchain network- it is minted with a unique code that provides personalised ownership. You can mint on NFT-based blockchain like Solana and Ethereum but most artists prefer Ethereum just because it was the first blockchain to host the NFTs and most popular. In this article, we’ll focus on Ethereum.
2.      You will then need the Ethereum native cryptocurrency ETH and the cryptocurrency wallet to mint the NFTs, they are crucial because they are used to pay the “gas fees' '. To mint, you will need to set up an account on the Opensea marketplace, you can also use Rarible or Mintable to mint.
 
Opensea and Rarible enable you to create NFTs on Ethereum with no upfront costs, this is due to the Lazy minting technique. Lazy minting is not registering the NFT on the blockchain until it’s purchased therefore avoiding any fees. Fees for writing or registering it on the blockchain are through the sale, therefore the buyer is solely responsible for minting the token.
 
Most marketplaces will enable you to list and sell NFTs. The guide on the
 Opensea website clearly describes the process of setting up the NFT for sale or auctioning. On Mintbase they’re listed for sale by default.
How to buy NFTs
Buying an NFT is relatively simpler than making an NFT. The following step-by-step procedure will enable you to buy an NFT of your choice easily on the Ethereum blockchain.
1.      You will need an Ethereum token ETH to buy NFT. If you don’t have it you can open an account on Coinbase or any other credible exchange platform to buy Ether.
2.      To store your purchased Ether you will need a cryptocurrency wallet. You can sign up with a platform like Metamask, Binance, or Coindesk.
3.      You then need to decide on the platform you would want to buy NFT from. Most popular marketplaces include Opensea, Raible, and Foundation.
4.      Connect your cryptocurrency wallet to the marketplace of your choice and you can begin bidding for NFT since most marketplaces use an auction system.
 
Where to store NFTs
Once you buy an NFT it is imperative to consider where you would hold your newly purchased collectible since it could be vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacks, and fraudulent activities in the exchange platform.
However, it’s also important to note that, you don’t store NFTs or crypto in your wallet but it provides access to your digital access stored on the blockchain. It is recommended to save and store NFTs on cold storage - an offline solution that is less susceptible to internet attacks. Purchasing a cold hardware wallet and transferring digital assets to the wallet enables one to be in charge and have full authority over assets.

Pros and Cons of NFTs
NFTs also have their disadvantages and advantages despite being the game-changer in the art world and digital assets, some of its pros and cons are,
Pros
1.      The NFTs keep records of authenticity which are verifiable on the blockchain. It becomes traceable and enables one to see and identify the owner of an NFT.
2.       The NFTs have empowered and motivated artists allowing them to sell directly to collectors and collect royalties once it’s resold. Through this, they can reduce costs of connecting to audiences through expensive agents and streamlining the transaction process, and enhancing the authentication process.
3.      Conversion of physical assets to digital assets can streamline processes and remove the need for intermediaries, it also boosts security through the use of blockchain technology that is almost impossible to hack.
4.      It potentially diversifies an investor’s portfolio if the investor has some liquidity and risk tolerance. Though they might be different from traditional investment vehicles and have different qualities, they offer real benefits. By adding them with other asset classes, it could improve efficiency.
5.      NFTs can also be used to divide ownership of physical assets. They have made it easier to divide the physical assets by providing a digitised version. As a result, it enhances greater liquidity and higher prices.
Cons
1.      NFTs are illiquid, volatile, and speculative investments since there is no historical research behind them, not many buyers and sellers fully understand them which make it very difficult to learn. It is a relatively new concept that is immature therefore investors are advised to tread with caution.
2.      They do not generate dividends to owners like the dividend-paying stocks or a rent generating real estate instead, the income fully depends on the price appreciation.
3.      Production of NFTs can have a long-term effect on the environment. Powering the blockchains which support the NFT production takes a significant amount of energy and carbon emissions due to the Proof of Work algorithm.
 
NFTs represent the future ownership in the digital age, but it also comes with a price. An individual investor ought to be cautious in this space since it’s highly unregulated. New and exciting projects are already flooding the NFT space as a sign that NFTs are here to stay.
